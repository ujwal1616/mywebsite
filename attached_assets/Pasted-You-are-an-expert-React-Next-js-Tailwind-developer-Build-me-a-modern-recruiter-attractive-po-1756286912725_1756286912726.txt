You are an expert React/Next.js + Tailwind developer. 
Build me a **modern, recruiter-attractive portfolio website** using Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript, fully responsive and optimized for fast loading. 
It should be host-ready on Replit or Vercel. 
Use a sleek design with a professional + creative vibe, because I am building a career in **AI, app development, and automation**.

  I am pursuing Columbia University’s *AI for Business* course (certificate upcoming), and I hold an NISM Equity Derivatives certification as well as a Certificate of Merit in Financial Management. 
  I aim to leverage AI, automation, and my financial acumen to create impactful solutions and secure roles in cutting-edge companies.
